# Horizon club activities

In this project I maintain ["horizon" club](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/clubs/horizon) activities.

The main focus of this project is mathematical modelling of real world systems.


## Activities done towards my application to the club


* [Basics of the S-I-R model](sir/main.tex)

* [The logistic map](logistic_map/Logistic_map.ipynb)

* [Numerical integration methods](integration_methods/Integration_Methods.ipynb)

* [Slope fields and differential equations](slope_fields/slope_fields.ipynb)

* [An introduction to chaos theory](chaos/main.tex)

* [pdf application report](pm_application.pdf)


### The following are part of the club activities:

* [The Mandelbrot set](mandelbrot/mandelbrot.js)

* [Animation of the Langton's ant](langton/langton.js)

* [Numerical solution of the Prey-Predator/Lotka-Volterra model](prey_predator.ipynb)
